# CHI-Motion-Magnification

Based on [EVM](http://people.csail.mit.edu/mrub/evm/)(Eulerian Video Magnification), we are able to reveal and amplify those small motions which is not observable by human eyes. In civil engineering field, this project is also practical when we are trying to capture those tiny structural changes.
